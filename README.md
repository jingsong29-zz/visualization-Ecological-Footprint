## Background and Motivation

The Ecological Footprint is the only metric that measures human demand on nature. It is a measure of human impact on Earthâ€™s ecosystem and reveals the dependence of the human economy on natural capital. Understanding how much nature we have and how much we use helps individuals to understand their impact on the planet, countries to improve sustainability and well-being, and local leaders to optimize public projects investments.
